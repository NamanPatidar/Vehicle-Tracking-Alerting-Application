# Vehicle-Tracking-Alerting-Application
The project aims at building an application that provides detailed information related to the management of the buses. The bus location and the driver details must be stored in Cloudant DB. Alerts are sent using the Fast2SMS service. The Application must be deployed using the IBM Cloud Foundry. Create an API Endpoint for the model with the help of IBM Cloud Functions. 

Project Description
Project Idea:

Transportation is the lifeline of any country, whether for commercial or personal purposes. The bus location tracking system makes management and administration of buses a far more simple and optimized process. With detailed bus location reports, any accident occurred, operations of buses can become streamlined. Moreover, the security of the passengers will be absolutely ensured with the help of our bus location tracking system.

Solution Required:

The project aims at building an application that provides detailed information related to the management of the buses. The bus location and the driver details must be stored in Cloudant DB. Alerts are sent using the Fast2SMS service. The Application must be deployed using the IBM Cloud Foundry. Create an API Endpoint for the model with the help of IBM Cloud Functions. 


Admin App: All the bus locations are shown on the map. Buses that are shown in the web application should have details like Driver Name, Mobile Number, Latitude, and longitude.

Driver App: Drivers should be able to login with their login details. The application should track the location of the mobile and update the database with current latitude and longitude. The Driver application should contain an emergency button to send an alert to the Admin.
